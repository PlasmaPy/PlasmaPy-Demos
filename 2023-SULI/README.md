# Computational Workshop for the 2023 SULI Introduction to Fusion Energy and Plasma Physics Course

Notebooks for this workshop can be run in three ways:

1. Online on **Google Colaboratory** (no setup needed, but must have a Google account)
  - [**Getting started with PlasmaPy**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-Demos/blob/main/2023-SULI/plasmapy-tutorial.ipynb) (part 1 with Nick)
  - [**Single particle drifts**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-Demos/blob/main/2023-SULI/single_particle_drifts.ipynb) (part 2 with Peter)

2. Online on **Binder** (no setup needed, but less reliable)

   [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-Demos/main)

3. On a **local installation of Python** that includes Jupyter notebook. (Advanced)

Some functionality, like interactive plots, may not work on Google Colaboratory. Instructions are included below for each option.

## Opening the Notebooks

To open the notebooks on **Google Colab**, please open the following links:

  - [Getting started with PlasmaPy](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-Demos/blob/main/2023-SULI/plasmapy-tutorial.ipynb) (part 1)
  - [Single particle drifts](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-Demos/blob/main/2023-SULI/single_particle_drifts.ipynb) (part 2)

## Running the Notebook

After opening each notebook, please execute the first code cell by pressing "Shift + Enter" in order to install PlasmaPy. After doing so, either click on the "Restart runtime" box in the output, or go to "Runtime" and select "Restart runtime":

# Running Examples on Binder <a name="installation_binder"></a>
  
To launch a **Binder** enviroment with PlasmaPy installed and example notebooks from this folder loaded, click the link below. The Binder enviroment takes some time (~5â€“10 minutes) to initialize, and that Binder may stop working if many people all sign on at once (e.g. during a large workshop). 
  
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-Demos/main)

Once the Binder enviroment has initialized, navigate to the folder with the name of this workshop and select the example notebook you want to run.

# Running Examples on Jupyter Notebook Locally with Anaconda <a name="installation_anaconda"></a>
1. Download the .ipynb file for the notebook(s)

   The notebooks can be downloaded from Google Drive by right clicking on the following links and choosing "Save As":

   - [Getting started with PlasmaPy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xf4M64Xp6e2tfo17W2Pm_6B1jzPy4L36/view?usp=sharing)
   - [Single particle drifts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tAXZOF3_TD5CBMsE_6eDdP_-M95_vcRD/view?usp=sharing)

2. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

3. Open Anaconda and do the following to create a new enviroment with PlasmaPy and all its dependencies installed.

  a) Select the 'Enviroments' tab.
  
  b) Left click on the green arrow.
  
  c) Click'Open Terminal' to open a command prompt.

4.  In the terminal, create a new virtual enviroment by entering the command "conda create -n suli -c conda-forge plasmapy". When prompted, enter 'Y' to proceed with the installation. Installation will take a few minutes.

5. Open the new enviroment and install Jupyter Notebook.

  a) Select the 'Home' tab.
  
  b) On the dropdown menu, select the newly created enviroment. 
  
  c) Click the 'Install' button under on the card for Jupyter Notebook.

6. Click 'Launch' on the Jupyter Notebook card. The program should open in your default web browser. Navigate to the downloaded .ipynb file and click on the title to open the notebook. ![anaconda_open_notebook](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-Demos/assets/32618747/67fa8cf0-4d92-4dc9-bee0-175dcd1d7f0f) 

# Tips on Using Jupyter Notebook <a name="jupyter_tips"></a>

- Select "Runtime>Run All" to run the entire notebook. 
- To run a single cell, select the cell with your mouse and then press "Shift+Enter"
- Create new cells using the "Insert" menu or the "+Code" button.
