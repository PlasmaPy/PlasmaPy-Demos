# Environment for the 2022 Omega Laser User Group (OLUG)

Notebooks from this folder can be run on Google Colaboratory (this will require a free Google account). 

To open a workbook, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab in your browser: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. You should see a window to select a file. If not, select "File>Open a Notebook" from the tool bar.

3. Select "GitHub" and enter the URL of the notebook you want to open in the search field. 

4. If the notebook does not open immediately, click on the notebook in the list of names that appears below the search bar.

Once the enviroment has opened, use the following tips to use it: 

- Select "Runtime>Run All" to run the entire notebook. 
- The first time you run a notebook that installs a package (like these), you may get an error. In this case, restart the runtime ("Runtime>Restart runtime") and the error should go away.
- To run a single cell, select the cell with your mouse and then press "Shift+Enter"
- Create new cells using the "Insert" menu or the "+Code" button.
